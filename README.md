# outs!dr

> syncing *outs!de* the box

---

**outs!dr** is a simple tool to synchronize your _clipboard_<sup>*</sup> across different devices.

You might ask — why? 🤨  
Well… I just got tired of using KDE Connect (:

\* It’s a clipboard *for now*, but who knows what comes next…

## ✨ features

- cross-device clipboard synchronization 
- modular design (rust core, multiple frontends)  
- open-source and extendable  
- privacy-focused: your data, your control
